# Autonomous_Line_Follower

To change:
- VCC1 of L293D as regulated 5V (use the PCB module)
- Bypass capacitors closer to pins
- Replace the 7805 with higher current carrying one
- Kapton tape everything
- PRECAUTION: before connecting STM32, connect a dummy load and measure fluctuation in voltage, if any
